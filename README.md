# Know Thyself v0.4

This a simplistic choose-your-adventure game where you are presented with multiple actions on different scenarios with an overarching and branching story. 
By the end of the story your chosen actions will determine what alignment you fall onto in the [Alignment Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)).
**Will you get the result you think you will?**

This software is currently in production, with 3 major versions planned:

- v0.5
Basic prototype release. User input will be fetched through a terminal and the story will be short.

_Current Comment:_
Almost here!!! Just need to finish story details and ensure there aren't any major bugs or text formatting issues.

Webapp version that will utilize Spring Boot and have a front-end. This will include Home, Play, About, & Credits as the main pages. Results will be saved. Possible longer or multiple stories.
